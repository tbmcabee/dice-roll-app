# DnD 5e Applications

Current Applications Implemented:
## DnD 5e Dice Roller app
* A user can roll a varity of dice (D4, D6, D8, D10, D12, D20) against user specified DC (Dice Checks) or roll for damage with the same set of dice options.
* When rolling against a DC, the user can add individual dice and set individual modifiers to each roll based on their character's stats. When a DC is meet or exceeded, the individual dice will change to a green color signifying success and a red dignifying a failure. 
* When rolling damnage rolls, the user can set a overall damage modifer along with the choice of setting "Crunchy Crits", which will maximize the damage of the first dice rolled. 
## DnD 5e API request app
* Within this example, I am pulling from the "races" endpoint from the Open5e API service to pull specific category information for each avaiable character race in DnD 5e.
* These categories include: "Name", "Ability Score Increase", "Speed", "Age", "Alignment", "Size", and"Languages"
